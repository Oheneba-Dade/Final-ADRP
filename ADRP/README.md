# Ashesi Data Repository Backend

This is the backend for the Ashesi Data Repository Project.
It has been built using the **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**. 
it serves purely as an API and does not render any of the frontend pages for the project.

### Key Features
1. **Authentication** via OTP and JWTs
2. **Email Notifications** 
3. **Uploading of Collections** and related dataset files
4. **Querying Collections** based on various criteria
5. **Site wide statistics** including number of downloads,views and submited collections


### Project Structure
-   The project follows the following structure

```

### Notes on project structure
- This project contains a single Django app 'ADRP'
- _service folders (in the backend_services folder) typically contain 2 files: _main.py and _repository.py
  - _main.py files contain classes which manage logic for different functionality e.g. AccountsService.get_otp would generate
  and associate an OTP with a given user
  - _repository.py files contain Database queries. They are separated from the _main.py files to keep the code DRY. Some DB queries require
  additional processing, as such we thought it best to separate them.


### How to run the backend server locally
To run the gunicorn server for the API you should:
1. CD into the project root as shown in the structure above
2. Create database migrations by typing the following in the terminal
```python manage.py makemigrations```
3. Apply database migrations with ```python mangage.py migrate```
4. Calculate site wide stats with ```python manage.py rebalancestats```
5. Run ```python manage.py collectstatic``` to build the static files needed for Django related pages
6. Finally, run the server with ```python manage.py runserver```


### Modifying API Settings
#### User related API Settings
Some of the settings that govern the general behaviour of the API can be modified in the ```settings.py``` file located in the
Django project folder (refer to the Project Structure section).

Settings that you may actually want to change include:
1. ```OTP_LIFETIME``` : The valid lifetime of a users OTP (in mins)
2. ```OTP_LENGTH``` : The number of characters in the OTP (changing this would requre changes to the frontend)
3. ```ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME``` : The number of hours that an access token is live for.
4. ```REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME``` : The number of hours that the refrsh token is live for. (Currently not being used)

#### Deployment config Settings
There are also some configs related to API Services that you may want to change once you are ready to deploy the app.
These include:
1. Email config and credentials for the SMTP based email notification service
2. Database config and cridentials
3. AWS bucket credentials.

All of these can be changed within the .env file


### Todo before deploying
The following checklist should be followed before the API is made publicly available:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/howto/deployment/checklist/


### Current deployment config
Currently, we use Docker for deployments. The relevant ```Dockerfile``` has been provided.
It is configured to run using the WSGI server with 4 workers attached. To scale, the number of workers can be increased.


### Future Improvements
1. Currently, the statistics are re-calculated every 6 hours. This is an okay implementation, but it is possible to
implement the Statistics Service such that it is only necessary when an update to the code base is made
2. Use celery for bacgkround tasks e.g sending of emails etc
